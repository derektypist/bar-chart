# Bar Chart

The aim of the project is to visualize data with a Bar Chart.

Functionality similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVaM.

## UX

My chart should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.

My chart should have a `g` element x-axis with a corresponding
`id="x-axis"`.

My chart should have a `g` element y-axis with a corresponding
`id="y-axis"`.

Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the corresponding `class="tick"`.

My chart should have a `rect` element for each data point with a corresponding `class="bar"`
displaying the data.

Each bar should have the properties `data-date` and `data-gdp` containing date and GDP values.

The bar elements' `data-date` properties should match the order of the provided data.

The bar elements `data-gdp` properties should match the order of the provided data.

Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.

The `data-date` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding
value on the x-axis.

The `data-gdp` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding
value on the y-axis.

I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays
more information about the area.

My tooltip should have a `data-date` property that corresponds to the `data-date` of the
active area.

Dataset at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json.

[Wireframes](wireframes/wireframe-bar-chart.png) are provided.

Year is on the x-axis and GDP is on the y-axis.

Data from 1947 to 2015.
